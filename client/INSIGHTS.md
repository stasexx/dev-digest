# Insights — client

Non-obvious findings and gotchas. Add an entry whenever something surprised you,
so the next agent/session doesn't relearn it. Append-only — see the
`engineering-insights` skill for how entries are captured.

## What Works

- **2026-06-14** — `formatCost` (`src/lib/cost.ts`) distinguishes MISSING data (`null`/`undefined` → "—") from a genuine zero (`0` → "$0.00"), widens precision for sub-cent values (~2 sig figs), and trims trailing zeros to a 2dp floor ("$0.06" not "$0.060", "$0.0013" not "$0.00"). Reuse it for any per-run money display.

## What Doesn't Work

- **2026-06-17** — The PR-list `tableCard` has `overflow: "hidden"` (`pulls/styles.ts`) which CLIPS absolutely-positioned hover popovers (`FindingsHoverCard`) opening downward from the bottom rows; upper rows render fine (matching the design). `FindingsHoverCard` is dependency-free (anchor wrapper + `position:absolute` panel) — to fully escape the card it would need a portal + `position:fixed` from the anchor's `getBoundingClientRect`. Deferred; not needed for the common case. Evidence: `client/src/components/FindingsHoverCard/`, `pulls/styles.ts:97`.
- **2026-09-20** — Prefilling a form from a query in `useEffect([data])` clobbers the user's edits whenever the query refetches (window focus) or a test mock returns a fresh object each render. Prefill once behind a ref flag. Evidence: `client/src/app/repos/[repoId]/conventions/_components/CreateSkillModal/CreateSkillModal.tsx` (`prefilled`).

## Codebase Patterns

- **2026-06-17** — `FindingsHoverCard` renders its panel in a `createPortal(document.body)` with `position:fixed` (coords measured from the anchor's `getBoundingClientRect` on open, recomputed on resize, closed on scroll). This is the fix for the earlier `overflow:hidden` clipping limitation — the panel escapes any clipping ancestor. Because the panel is outside the anchor's subtree, BOTH the anchor and the portal panel carry the open/close mouse handlers (shared 120ms timer) so the pointer can cross the gap. Evidence: `client/src/components/FindingsHoverCard/FindingsHoverCard.tsx`.
- **2026-06-17** — Finding deep-linking: a findings popover navigates to `…/pulls/:number?tab=findings&finding=:id`. The PR-detail page reads `?finding`, forces the findings tab, and threads `focusFindingId` → `FindingsTab` (resolves finding→run, reuses the `targetRunId` open+scroll) → `ReviewRunAccordion` (opens if it owns the finding) → `FindingsPanel` (scrolls to `[data-finding-id]` + `defaultExpanded`). A finding's file:line link opens the PR's Files tab (`githubPrFilesUrl`), not the standalone blob. Evidence: `pulls/[number]/page.tsx`, `FindingsTab`, `ReviewRunAccordion`, `FindingsPanel`.

- **2026-06-18** — `BarChart2` and `GripVertical` do NOT exist in the `@devdigest/ui` icon registry. Use `BarChart` for charts and a unicode character (e.g. `⠿`) for drag handles. Always verify icon names against `client/src/vendor/ui/icons.tsx` before using them — a wrong name silently renders nothing because Icon is a proxy object.
- **2026-06-18** — The `AgentEditor` tab system has TWO places to update: `TABS` constant in `AgentEditor/constants.ts` (controls the tab bar) and `VALID_TABS` array in `agents/[id]/page.tsx` (validates the `?tab=` URL param). Both must be kept in sync when adding a tab — missing VALID_TABS causes the new tab to silently redirect to `config`. Evidence: `client/src/app/agents/[id]/_components/AgentEditor/constants.ts`, `client/src/app/agents/[id]/page.tsx:15`.

- **2026-06-14** — Cross-route shared components live in `src/components/<Name>/` with an `index.ts` barrel, imported via `@/components/<Name>` (e.g. `RunCostBadge`, `diff-viewer`). Vendored UI primitives (`Badge`, `CircularScore`) live in `src/vendor/ui` under `@devdigest/ui` — different home. Evidence: `client/src/components/RunCostBadge/`.
- **2026-06-14** — The PR-list table is driven by two parallel constants that MUST stay length-aligned: `COLUMN_KEYS` (header keys + order) and `GRID` (CSS grid-template tracks). Adding a column = add to both AND render a matching cell in `PRRow.tsx`, else header/cells misalign silently. Evidence: `client/src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/constants.ts`.
- **2026-06-14** — i18n has only the `en` locale (`client/messages/en/`); new UI strings need a key under the right namespace file (e.g. `prReview.json`, `runs.json`) read via `useTranslations("<ns>")`. A missing key renders the raw key, not an error.
- **2026-09-20** — Sidebar lives in `src/vendor/ui/nav.ts`; items support `:repoId` templating and the active key for `/conventions` was already mapped in `components/app-shell/helpers.ts`. `ConfidenceNum` renders `"87% conf"` (not `87%`) — match that in tests. `githubBlobUrl(full_name, ref, file, line)` accepts a branch name as `ref` when there is no sha.

## Session Notes

### 2026-06-18
- Built Skills UI (L02): `lib/hooks/skills.ts`, `/skills` page + SkillsListView + SkillCard + ImportDrawer, `/skills/[id]` + SkillEditor with Config/Preview/Versions/Stats tabs, AgentEditor SkillsTab (HTML5 DnD reorder, checkbox link/unlink), nav SKILLS LAB section, i18n keys.
- Skills tab added to AgentEditor — both `constants.ts` (TABS) and `page.tsx` (VALID_TABS) updated.
### 2026-09-20 (HW-2)
- Conventions page (`/repos/:repoId/conventions`): Run Scan / ReScan, candidate cards with GitHub evidence links, Accept/Reject/inline Edit, Create-skill modal with editable body. Agents moved to SKILLS LAB. Skills list: side preview drawer, create modal, delete confirmation modal, version + agent count. Trace shows `~N tokens` for the skills block only.
